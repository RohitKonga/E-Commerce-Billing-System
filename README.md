#ðŸ”—E-Commerce Billing System

This is a console-based inventory and billing management system developed in C. It supports two roles: Admin and Customer. Admins can add, update, and delete inventory items, as well as view past bills. Customers can browse items, add them to the cart, generate final bills (with tax calculation), and save bill history to a file. The program handles data storage using text files and supports secure admin login with masked password input.
